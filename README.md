# PersistentBST

Welcome to the Persistent Binary Search Trees (BSTs) repository! This repository hosts implementations of persistent BSTs using various techniques such as fat nodes, path copying, and copy on-write. Persistent data structures play a crucial role in computer science by allowing efficient manipulation of data while preserving the previous versions of the data structure.

**Features**

**Fat Nodes:** Optimize memory usage by storing additional metadata alongside each node, reducing the need for excessive copying during updates.

**Path Copying:** Optimize the creation of new versions by copying only the nodes that are modified, resulting in efficient updates while maintaining the integrity of previous versions.

**Copy on-Write:** Optimize memory usage by employing a copy-on-write strategy, where modifications are made to a separate copy of the data structure only when necessary, ensuring efficient use of memory resources.

**Usage**

1. Clone Repo
